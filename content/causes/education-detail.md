# Our Initiative in Education

**Hero Tagline:** The path out of poverty begins when the next generation can access quality education.

## Overview

The Singal Foundation partnered with the Dream Centers to fund 8 schools in the slum communities of India. The schools were pioneered in response to an overwhelming need in the city of Mumbai and across India. These schools are unique because of their self-sustaining model. After a one-time investment of $45,000, each school becomes completely self-sufficient. As part of the community empowerment program, a nominal fee is charged to the students which is able to sustain all the expenses of the school. Our vision is to give every child an opportunity to get a quality education and with your help, we can make that a reality.

## The Issue

Statistics about education crisis in India:

- **266 million** people can't read or write
- **35 million** children do not go to school
- **47 million** children dropout by grade 10
- **35%** - Around 35% of the world's illiterate population comes from India
- **30%** - About 30% of children who enroll in grade 1 do not reach grade 8
- **50%+** - About 50% of 10 year old's cannot solve grade 3 math problems

## The Approach

### 1. Early Childhood Education

The Right to Education Act in India guarantees free public school education to children in the age group of 6-14 years. However, early childhood education (3-5 years) is not a provision under this act. It can only be accessed through privately run schools which are very costly. Hence, the ARC school focuses heavily on pre-primary education.

This ensures the children are provided with a solid foundation in these early stages. The curriculum is a mix of academics and activity based learning. Research shows that when these children are given a formidable early education, they are less likely to dropout of the public school system.

### 2. Support Classes

Most of the children who are mainstreamed into formal school will not be able to get after school support from their parents because they are either uneducated or too busy making ends meet. Since the parents are not educated, the support they can provide their children is very limited.

In order to maintain their level of motivation as well as provide quality education input after school, support classes are provided to the children of ARC School. This will give the children personalized attention and support by qualified teachers and volunteers which will drastically reduce their chances of dropping out of school.

### 3. Teacher Training Programs

Bringing children to schools does not equate to quality learning. One of the major shortcomings of the Indian educational system is a shortage of well qualified teachers. 1 in 6 elementary school teachers are not professionally trained. The country falls short of nearly 1 Million teachers.

Hence, the ARC School has started its own Training Center for Teachers in Early Education in order to combat this issue. They are changing the way teachers are supported and trained to ensure that the students are learning effectively. It includes an internship across all the ARC schools which is an integral part of the program.

### 4. Community Empowerment

The ARC schools believe in establishing partnerships with their communities. This in turn increases the commitment of the parents towards their children's education. Instead of providing education free of cost, a subsidized fee is taken from the students. Our research shows that charging a small fee increases the accountability of the parents and children.

Parents are more likely to take an interest in their children's education and ensure consistent attendance. An attempt is also made to recruit and train teachers from within the community.

### 5. Self Sustainability

Each school cost $45,000 to build. This initial investment goes towards refurbishing costs, rent, teacher's salaries, marketing, furniture, books and school uniforms. After the initial investment of $45,000, the school becomes completely self-sufficient by month 18 with no additional funding from outside sources.

The school is able to cover all their expenses after 18 months with the nominal fee that is paid by the students. Once we have 50 schools, the profits from these 50 schools will help fund other schools without the need for any additional capital.

### 6. Health and Sanitation

Most of the 100 sq foot slum houses where the children come from do not have proper sanitation and water facilities. 443 million school days are lost each year because of water-and sanitation-related diseases. As a by-product of the school, educating children and parents on health and sanitation is an integral part of the project.

In these workshops, the children and parents are educated on healthy sanitation behaviour. Every year the children are given free health checkups and provided with primary dental care. These workshops and medical clinics are critical in keeping the children healthy and happy.

### 7. Adult Learning

It's never too late to learn something new! The adult learning programs provide the community with the opportunity to engage in various classes and workshops. Some of their past initiatives include training programs for women entrepreneurs, workshops on parenting, music and photography.
