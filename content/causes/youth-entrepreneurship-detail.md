## The Approach

### 1. One-Day Marketplace

The Singal Foundation was the premier sponsor for the Children's Business Fair held in Rockville, Maryland in 2018 and 2019. At the Children's Business Fair, children create a product or service, develop a brand, build a marketing strategy and then open for customers at a one-day marketplace.

The children are responsible for the set-up, customer interaction and sales. The possibilities are limited only to what children can create. Prizes are given to the best business by age and category. We love the practical approach of the fair and all of the learning opportunities it gives these budding entrepreneurs.

### 2. Coaching & Training

The Singal Foundation partnered with the Children's Business Fair in 2019 to host pre-fair workshops where our budding entrepreneurs were taught how to develop their communication skills and sales techniques. The training included topics like sales, marketing, booth presentation, product packaging, pricing, sales pitch strategy and much more.
