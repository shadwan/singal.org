# Our Initiative in Medical Relief

**Hero Tagline:** We can save lives by delivering healthcare services to those in need.

## Overview

The Singal Foundation donated a total of $55,000 to SEAL Ashram in Mumbai India, for the construction of a much needed hospital for the destitute. SEAL Ashram is a non-profit organization that rescues needy and helpless people from the streets and railway stations of Mumbai. It also provides those rescued with food, clothing, shelter, health-care and education.

## The Issue

Statistics about medical care crisis in India:

- **1:10,189** - There is 1 doctor for every 10,189 patients in India
- **1:75,000** - There is one doctor for 75k patients in rural India
- **1:2046** - There is one hospital bed for very 2046 patients
- **1:90,343** - There is one state-run hospital for every 90k+ patients
- **1 in 5** - Doctors in rural India are not qualified to practise
- **2** - Children under the age of 5 die every minute

## Where We Work

**Location:** SEAL Ashram is a shelter home for destitute individuals abandoned on the streets of Mumbai, India.

## The Approach

### 1. Free Medical Treatment

Patients with infectious diseases like incurable tuberculosis or H.I.V. are sometimes refused treatment in Indian hospitals where under equipped or undereducated staff members are frightened of getting infected. Not only does this kind of behavior defy the ethical standards of the medical practice, but it delays the treatment these patients need to survive.

Hence, SEAL Ashram is in the process of building a hospital that will provide free medical treatment to the residents of the Ashram or anyone unable to afford treatment. The individuals brought to this facility are generally those affected by diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other chronic physical and mental illness.

### 2. Safe Housing

Today, SEAL is a shelter home for over 265 people. At SEAL Ashram, the residents are provided with food, clothing, shelter, health care and an education. However, they are unable to admit any more residents into their facility due to lack of space.

Once the hospital project is completed, the women and girls will be moved into the new facility so room can be made to bring in more residents. The new hospital will accommodate around 200 patients including existing and future residents of the SEAL organization.
