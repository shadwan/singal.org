# Our Initiative in Entrepreneurship

**Hero Tagline:** We believe in empowering individuals so they can lift themselves out of poverty.

## Overview

In 2017, the Singal Foundation partnered with Village Enterprise to fund a village in East Africa for $25,000. Village Enterprise is a non-profit organization that equips rural Africans with the resources to create sustainable businesses. The organization focuses on the micro-enterprise sector. Established in 1987, Village Enterprise is active in the poverty reduction and micro-enterprise development fields, targeting people living below the extreme poverty level of $1.90 a day or less, especially women and youth.

## The Issue

Statistics about poverty in Africa:

- **767 million** - Worldwide live on less than $1.90
- **389 million** - Live in extreme poverty in Africa
- **589 million** - Live without electricity in Africa
- **30%** - Youth are unemployed in Africa
- **40%** - Cannot access clean water in Africa
- **60%** - Youth between 15-17 are not in school in Africa

## Where We Work

## The Approach

### 1. Training

The Village Enterprise one-year Graduation program provides groups of three entrepreneurs with seed capital, training and ongoing mentoring by a local business mentor. Examples of businesses include livestock, farming, small retail stores and restaurants, tailoring, and beekeeping.

Business mentors deliver nine months of business and financial skills training designed for participants who have little formal education and assist them in forming small enterprises of three budding entrepreneurs each.

### 2. Business Savings Group

At the beginning of the training, a Business Savings Groups (BSGs) of approximately 10 businesses (30 entrepreneurs) each is created. BSGs are a self-generating, self-managed form of microfinance that allow members to pool savings and access loans.

This allows them access to growth capital, provides a safe place for savings, and builds social capital. The Business Savings Groups serve as a safety net. It also provides members with ongoing protection against financial shocks and access to growth capital.

### 3. Seed Funding

To light the fire of entrepreneurship, $150 micro-grants as seed capital are given to start each business. Participants in the program are given grants rather than loans as this allows them to take on the risk of starting a new business. A $150 micro-grant sparks the ingenuity of entrepreneurs who are willing to invest time and energy into improving their lives.

First-time entrepreneurs are more willing to take the risk of starting a new business venture if they don't fear the high costs of failure and further indebtedness or loss of meager assets potentially caused by a loan default. Profits generated from their new enterprise can be used to address critical family needs (like food, medicine and school fees) and build capital and savings for their fledgling business, rather than to repay high-interest loans.

### 4. Mentoring

Business mentors guide each new group in selecting an enterprise that is best positioned to flourish, taking into account the team's skill set, local market conditions, risk factors, and profitability. Each business is assigned a local mentor and is organized into a Business Savings Group of 30 entrepreneurs to provide access to savings.

Multiple studies show that the Graduation programs lead to significant increases in household income, and that these benefits persist over a number of years. So far, Village Enterprise has started over 44,000 businesses and trained over 175,000 East Africans.
