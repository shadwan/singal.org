# Our Initiative in Disaster Relief - COVID-19

**Hero Tagline:** We are committed to providing tangible relief to those affected by natural disasters.

## Overview

Singal Foundation in partnership with Lurn, Inc started the COVID-19 Entrepreneurship Fund in March 2020. The purpose of the fund was to provide grants ranging from $50 to $500 to small-business owners who were negatively impacted by COVID-19. The grant was for any urgent or essential needs like groceries, medicine and transportation. The fund raised $60,182 and gave grants to 277 small business owners in 22 different countries.

## The Issue

COVID-19 pandemic impact statistics:

- **$22.2 Million** - Jobs Lost in the United States

- **96 Million+** - Confirmed Cases Worldwide
- **2 Million+** - Deaths

## The Approach

### 1. Fundraising

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, almost all small businesses were negatively impacted while hourly workers were either laid off or furloughed. Every state in America and around the world announced forced closures of businesses and 90% of Americans were asked to stay at home.

Anyone in the entrepreneurial community who had an existing business or was being impacted by COVID-19 could apply for a grant. Grants in the range of $50 to $500 were given to small-business owners who were in urgent need of necessities like groceries, medicine or transportation.

The Singal Foundation and Lurn contributed $30,000 towards the Fund #1 while Fund #2 raised $30,000 from our entrepreneurial community.
