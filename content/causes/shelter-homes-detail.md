# Our Initiative in Shelter Homes

**Hero Tagline:** We believe in giving everyone access to a stable and safe environment in which they can grow and thrive.

## Overview

In 2016, the Singal Foundation donated $10,000 to Compassion Asia, a shelter home in Nepal for visually impaired and blind children. This home often cares for fifteen to seventeen kids at a time. The children's home is located in the Jumla district of Nepal. This area is one of the least developed regions of the country. Until 2015, the home was only accessible via an eleven hour trek from the Jumla airstrip. The home gives these vulnerable children the ability to hope and dream again. We believe that every individual should have access to a safe and stable environment where they can grow, thrive and live life to their fullest potential.

## The Issue

Statistics about visual impairment in Nepal:

- **30,240** - Nepalese children are blind
- **90,000+** - Children are visually impaired
- **80%** - Visual impairment can be avoided

## Where We Work

**Location:** Compassion Asia works with visually impaired and blind children in the Jumla District of Nepal.

## The Approach

### 1. Basic Necessities

Little food, inadequate clothing, harsh living conditions, no sight, no hope. These are the conditions of the fifteen children before they came to live in the hostel for blind children in Jumla, Nepal. Just about all of the children have families, but they are so poor that caring for a blind child is an extra burden on them.

Compassion Asia took these vulnerable children in and began caring for them. They provide the children with good food, adequate clothing and a safe environment to live in.

### 2. Education

Through a special arrangement with the Nepali government, Compassion Asia helps supplement the children's schooling by paying the salary for a teacher who is trained to work with the blind.

The teacher is able to provide the children with the special attention they need. Compassion Asia pays for their braille books, which are very expensive, and purchased in Kathmandu.

Since April of 2009, Compassion Asia claims that they have seen dramatic improvements in the living conditions, health, and emotional well-being of the children.
