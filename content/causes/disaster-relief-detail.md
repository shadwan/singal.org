## The Approach

### 1. Fundraising

Most of the relief funds at the time were going toward meeting people's essential needs such as food, clothing and shelter. Our hearts went out to small business owners who lost not only their homes, but also their businesses and livelihood.

Anik Singal started a GoFundMe campaign and pledged to match the dollar amount for every dollar raised. The campaign raised $22,615 dollars and the Singal Foundation was able to match the amount of donations as promised.

### 2. Business Grants

Anik and his team also flew to Houston, Texas to visit small business owners and see the devastation first-hand. Grants were given to 7 small business owners. There were tears of joy and hearts that were touched by the generosity of the Singal Foundation and it's partners.

Some of the small businesses included a boutique, real estate firm, chiropractor practice and a gym to name a few.
