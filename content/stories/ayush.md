## Story Content

When Ayush first came to the ARC school, he would barely talk to anyone.The ARC schools serve children from disadvantaged groups living in the slum community of India.

The teacher's tried their very best to communicate with him but he refused to talk. It took the teachers a while to realize he had a speech disorder.

The teachers decided not to give up on him and did their very best. They diligently communicated with him daily and got him to eventually open up to them.

By the end of the first year, he was able to fluently recite the alphabet. At the end of the second year, he could read his textbooks. Even though he still struggles to communicate as clearly as the other kids, the teachers say his ability to grasp a subject matter far exceeds those of the other students.

He is a very energetic child and is extraordinarily talented at drawing. Ayush dreams of becoming a civil engineer when he grows up. The teachers have no doubt that he will be successful at whatever he chooses to do.
