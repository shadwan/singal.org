## Story Content

Joanna Peak has been a personal trainer for 15 years. She has always been an avid fitness enthusiast and played basketball all through college.

When Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, it wiped out Joanna's entire business. All her training equipment was ruined, the carpets had to be replaced and she needed a completely new paint job.

To make matters worse, this was the THIRD time that her space was ruined by a flood. This time, Joanna wasn't sure if she would recover.

We decided to give Joanna a grant of $7,000 dollars. She was very appreciative with the help she received. It gave her the hope she needed to keep marching forward.

We followed up with her to find out how she was doing. She was so grateful for the generosity of the Singal Foundation & it's partners. With a grant from the Singal Foundation and others in the community, Joanna was able to replace all of her equipment, and was up and running again within 6 weeks of the flood.
