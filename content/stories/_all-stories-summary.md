## Content Patterns for Redesign

2. **Visual-Heavy:** Large hero images essential
3. **Specific Outcomes:** Concrete numbers (weeks, dollars, people)
4. **Before/After:** Clear transformation narrative
5. **Quotes:** Direct beneficiary voices add authenticity
6. **Community Impact:** Individual → family → community ripple effects
7. **Dignity:** "Empower" not "help" - business ownership, not charity
8. **Interconnected:** Same villages/programs appear across stories

This summary provides all essential content for the remaining story extractions and redesign planning.
