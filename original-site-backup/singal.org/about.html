          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <!-- <p>Anik Singal is the Founder and CEO of Lurn, Inc. He is an Inc 500 CEO, listed twice as the Fastest Growing Companies in America and Businessweek recognized him in the Top 3 of the Best Entrepreneurs Under 25.</p>
          <p>In 2014, Anik moved into a luxury apartment in Mumbai, India. This apartment building was home to some of the country’s wealthiest people including Bollywood film stars and businessmen.</p>
          <p>Yet, right across the street from this expensive sky rise was one of India’s largest slums communities. According to the World Bank, 54% of Mumbai’s population lives in slums - an estimated 6.2 million out of 11.5 million people.</p>
          <p>While Anik lived in luxury, his neighbors right across the street were living in mud houses and cardboard boxes. This thought would plague his mind day after day. He was especially worried about the future of the children in the community.</p> -->
          <p>The Singal Foundation is founded by Anik & Andrea Singal. Their goal remains simple - never to give, but only to EMPOWER. The initiatives of the organization are worldwide and include causes related to education, entrepreneurship, medical and disaster relief.</p>
 
<p>From building schools in India, to funding micro-businesses in Africa, to equipping youth  with financial education in the United States, the Singal Foundation seeks to empower the lives of individuals  around the globe.

          <p>This was the first initiative of the Singal Foundation.  Since then, the Foundation has funded the development of 8 schools across India.

          <p>The Singal Foundation has funded the development of eight schools across India. The schools cater to underprivileged children living in the slums of Mumbai, India. The schools were pioneered in response to an overwhelming need in the city of Mumbai and across India. </p>
          <p>The curriculum involves a mix of academics and activity based training to ensure the children have a solid foundation in the early stages. The schools also offer free health check-ups and adult learning programs as part of the community development program. </p>
