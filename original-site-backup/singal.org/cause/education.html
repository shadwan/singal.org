The schools were pioneered in response to an overwhelming need in the city of Mumbai and across India. These schools are unique because of their self-sustaining model. After a one-time investment of $45,000, each school becomes completely self-sufficient. As part of the community empowerment program, a nominal fee is charged to the students which is able to sustain all the expenses of the school.
