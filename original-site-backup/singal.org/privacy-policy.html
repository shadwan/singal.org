        <h3><strong>Cookies  and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></h3>
        <p>As is true of most Sites, we gather certain information automatically  and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP)  addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,  the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating  system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the  aggregate and administer the site.<br>
          Singal Foundation uses cookies or similar technologies to store session  information, analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movements  around the Sites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as  a whole. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous  unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and  stored on your computer’s hard drive.<br>
          We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID  cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to track  your login status. This cookie is only ever transmitted over HTTPS. A persistent  cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use  persistent cookies to determine from where you were referred to our Sites and  recognize the last user ID that you used to log in. We may set and access  Singal Foundation cookies on your computer; cookies are required to use the  Sites.</p>
        <h3><strong>Third  Party Tracking</strong></h3>
        <p>Third parties also use cookies and other tracking technologies on our  site, of which data is only collected in the aggregate. Our Privacy Policy does  not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not have access or control  over these cookies. Third parties use session ID and persistent cookies to make  it easier for you to navigate the Sites, in order for you to use the shopping  cart, and to otherwise use our services.</p>
        <h3><strong>Behavioral  Targeting / Re-Targeting</strong></h3>
        <p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising  on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner  uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information  about your activities on this and other websites. This information is used to  provide you targeted advertising across the internet, based upon your  interests.</p>
        <h3><strong>Disclosure  of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></h3>
        <p>Our practices with respect to the disclosure of personally identifiable information  include the following:</p>
        <p><u>Consent</u>. We may disclose your personally identifiable information  to third parties with your express consent.</p>
        <p><u>Agents/Service Providers</u>. We use third party service providers to  assist us in providing our Services and Sites, including database backup  providers to protect our data, and fraud prevention services. We may disclose  your personally identifiable information to third parties who complete  transactions or perform services on our behalf or for your benefit. We may utilize  the services of third parties to verify customer data, or to supplement other  information we have collected. We may also contract with third parties to host  our Sites and to conduct market research. All service providers are authorized  to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide  their respective services to us, and are obligated to protect your personally  identifiable information under contract terms which are no less protective than  those set forth in this Policy.</p>
        <p><u>Legal Process</u>. We may disclose your personally  identifiable information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena  or other legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is  necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,  investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.<br>
          You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Sites of  any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as  well as any resulting choices you may have regarding your personally  identifiable information.</p>
        <h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
        <p>The security of your personally identifiable information is important to  us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card number on our  registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using SSL.</p>
        <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the  personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission  and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method  of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to  use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable  information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <p>The information we collect about you is stored in limited access  servers. We maintain safeguards to protect the security of these servers and  your personally identifiable information. We retain personally identifiable  information only as long as necessary to complete a purchase, thwart fraud, or  provide customer service.</p>
        <h3><strong>Links  to Other Sites</strong></h3>
        <p>If you click on a link to a third party site you will leave our site and  go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third  parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally  identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that  they will adhere to the same privacy practices as us. We encourage you to  review the privacy policies of any other site you visit or service provider  from whom you request services.</p>
        <h3><strong>Changes  to This Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we  make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, or by means of a  notice on the Site. If we make any substantial change to the way we use your  personally identifiable information, we will notify you by email. You will have  an opportunity to opt out of such new or different uses of your personally  identifiable information prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage  you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy  practices.</p>
